/* This will be the long awaited (my ass) sequel to one of my favorite projects
 * of all time, Zuul. The goal of this project is to create a much larger game
 * using the same game engine, but more streamlined and easier to read for
 * debugging purposes. As well, the story won't be created solely by myself this
 * time, so it might have a completely different flavor. I don't really care, so
 * long as I get my stupid jokes and references in.
